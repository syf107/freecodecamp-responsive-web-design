              In late 19th-century England, the young son of a wealthy
              landowner, Jonathan Joestar, meets his new adopted brother Dio
              Brando, who loathes him and plans to usurp him as heir to the
              Joestar family. When Dio's attempts are thwarted, he transforms
              himself into a vampire with the use of an ancient Stone Mask and
